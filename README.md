# Project Title

The Golem and the Imp

## Description

This project involves applying the principles of looping and conditionals in the Python programming language. The objective is to create a game where an imp is attempting to evade a pursuing golem. The scenario envisions the imp being confined in a golem tunnel and seeking to break free through a 50-feet passage. To facilitate its escape, the imp starts  at 5 feet, while the golem begins at 0 feet. Successful escape occurs if the imp reaches the end of the 50-feet tunnel. However, if the golem's speed surpasses that of the imp, it signifies a failed escape attempt.

https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
### Executing program
There are three files that you can run. 
GISimulation.ipynb, GISimulation.py, and GISimple.py

The first two files are same depending on how you run one of the them. 
to run the file with .ipynb, 
Open your Anacoda Prompt, activate your enviroment, and type jyupter notebook.
This will open your files in browser. Navigate to where your GISimulation.ipynb and run it.

To run  GISimulation.py and GISimple.py

Open a terminal of your choise. Gitbash is good one to use. 

Navigate to folder where those two files are located. 

Run the following command

Python nameofyourfile.py
Ex : Python GISimulation.py or
     Python GISimple.py

If you want to run the GISimple.py without any argument, simply keep hitting the enter key.
